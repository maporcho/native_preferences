# native_preferences

A Flutter plugin that reads key-value pairs from SharedPreferences and NSUserDefaults, making it easier to migrate from purely native code to Flutter.

It provides an easy way to retrive values stored under different keys in the Android and iOS versions of an app, and makes no assumptions on the preference file name or key prefix.
